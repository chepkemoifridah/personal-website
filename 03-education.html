    <h2>Primary Education</h2>
    <p>
        My junior level education laid the foundation for my learning journey.
        During <br>this stage, I developed basic literacy, numeracy, discipline, <br>and
        a strong interest in learning.
    </p>

    <h2>Secondary Education</h2>
    <p>
        At the senior level, I enhanced my academic abilities and personal<br>
        discipline. I participated in various subjects and activities that
        strengthened<br> my problem-solving skills and prepared me for higher
        education.
    </p>

    <h2>University Education</h2>
    <p>
        I am currently a second-year university student pursuing a degree in
        Software<br> Engineering. This level has equipped me with programming skills,
        logical thinking, <br>and practical experience in software development.
